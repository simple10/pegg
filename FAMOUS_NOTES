use css property (webkitBackVisibility) to show back of surface so you can see the back when flipping a surface
intersecting surfaces: in chrome and firefox, doesn't look good. won't until browser fixes. fix: don't intersect surfaces
surface ordering: browsers paint in the order that DOM elements are listed (if no z-index, translation in z space)
try to divert to css ordering (z-index) when you can
you lose the ability to translate in z-space with too many nested container surfaces
changing the size of DOM elements is SLOW... use modifiers not properties on Surface
make sure your surface bounds all your content (going outside causes reflow, repaint)
there is an upper limit to how many surfaces you can have in famo.us, careful adding too many
performance tweak: trim down render tree size


if you don't set perspective, rotate might look funny
you can change the max framerate

Flux- photons per area /sec
LOOK UP

Touch -
Views donâ€™t emit, surfaces need to emit, pipe up and out

Collapse Choices -
Choices need to be Views with modifiers (x2, 1 for rotation, 1 for size, Transitioble to manage state) before surfaces
